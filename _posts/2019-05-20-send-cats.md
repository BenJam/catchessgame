This summer we (Con Gas Games) will be launching our second boardgame: Cat Chess. Here's a little more about the game:

> Cat Chess is a 3D boardgame for 2 or more players lasting 20-30 minutes, suitable for 8 year olds and above. Cat Chess is a battle from the streets to the rooftops. Build the city and move, climb and scuffle your team of cats for the best vantage points to keep an eye on their rivals. If you like games that are a mix of strategy, chance and dexterity then you'll love Cat Chess.

We'll be launching Cat Chess on Kickstarter, and we'd love you (okay, your cat/s) to be a part of it. Send us a short (<5s)video of your cat, preferably spying on other cats from a window, balcony or behind the sofa and we'll feature them in our campaign video. We'll also randomly pick one cat to feature in the final print of the boardgame, which means there's a chance we might immortalise your cat as a resin miniature. Imagine that! 

To enter upload your footage (HD video only please!) to your planform of choice and email us a link at [hello@catchessgame.com](hello@catchessgame.com). Please note that by sending us footage you are granting us permission to use that footage in our marketing campaigns. 

If you'd like us to email you when the project is live you can fill out our [contact form](/contact).
