In 2015 Con Gas Games launched [Attack The Pack](https://attackthepack.com) on Kickstarter, a cycling game for and by cycling enthusiasts. Four years on we are developing our second boardgame: Cat Chess!

Cat Chess is a battle for cat-supremacy in New York, from the streets to the rooftops. You'll be building the city in 3D using floor and wall tiles and moving your gang of cats through the city for the best vantage points to keep an eye on other team's cats. If you like games that are a mix of strategy, change and dexterity then you'll love Cat Chess. 

We'll be launching Cat Chess to the public in May/June this year. If you'd like us to email you when the project is live you can fill out our [contact form](/contact) otherwise you can follow up on Twitter and Instagram by following the links in the footer.
