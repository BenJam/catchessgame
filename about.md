Cat Chess is a boardgame for 2 or more players lasting 20-30 minutes, suitable for 8 year olds and above. 

Cat Chess is a battle for cat-supremacy in the city, from the streets to the rooftops. You'll be building the city that your gang of cats will move, climb and scuffle over the best vantage points to keep an eye on other cats. Cats score one point for every cat they can see and lose one point for each cat that cat see them. 

We'll be updating this page with the full set of rules, pre-production graphics and limited edition artboards when Cat Chess goes live on Kickstarter in May/June. Until then you can read more about the development of Cat Chess (and boardgames in general) on [our blog](/posts) and sign up to receive an email when Cat Chess is avaialble on Kickstarter on [our contact page](/contact)
